# URL-Shortener

### Welcome to this awesome URL shortener! 

When you enter a URL, the shortener creates a short URL, then both of them are stored in a cloud database with MongoDB Atlas. By using the short URL, it redirects you to the original URL.

I have developed this app using JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, Mongoose, Body-Parser, and MongoDB Atlas. If you want to clone the repository, make sure to install all these dependencies.

> I hope you enjoy it!
